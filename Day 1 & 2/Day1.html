            <p>This letter is to inform you that there is an opportunity to attend online coding bootcamp for students organised by devsnest.This bootcamp is completely free of cost, the duration of which would be 6 months.
            As this field is getting competitive day by day and there are very less opportunities like these, I would like to take this opportunity. It will help me to improve my skills and also allow me to get an idea of what the other students are capable of.
            <br>The bootcamp covers the following :- <br>
            <table border="1">

                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
